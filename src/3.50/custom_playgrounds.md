# Custom Playgrounds

Currently, a developer can clone the Playground repository and deploy the Playground locally or on a VM with public access. In this regard, a developer can test new weblets and even make their weblets available for public testing.

We thus propose to create a Playground market, where developers could share their new weblets, get feedback and questions from users in order to improve and refine their weblets.

At first, this could be done simply: we add a forum categorie "Custom Playgrounds", where developers can share the links to their Playgrounds. Users could then test the new weblets and give their feedback. This simple approach wouldn't require a lot of resources and it would give a public platform for developers to showcase their creations.

This concept could be further elaborated. We only present the basics.
