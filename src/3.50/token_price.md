## Introduction

TFGrid 3.50 aims at stabilizing the token price.
***
## Current Situation

The token price should be the reflection of our traction of the grid, which isn’t the case today because of the following:

* We keep on generating more TFT (supply) than there is current demand (e.g. for staking & utilization).
* Too many farmers need to sell their TFT to pay for their expenses, so we keep on having too much sales pressure.
* There is no staking model, which doesn’t allow the community to express their support.
* We don’t have enough promotion & communication budget yet.
* We don’t have enough commercial solution providers pushing utilization of the grid.

***

## What Will Change

What is happening over the next months is important to resolve this:

* As presented in this document:
  * The farming model will be changed.
  * The staking model will be introduced.
* There will be a lot less of TFT farming (minting) starting from Zero-OS 4.0, as TFT will become the reserve currency while CHI will be the new currency for farming.
* ThreeFold Grid 4.0 introduces the concept of Regional Internets, which will drive TFT utilization to a large extent.
* Large TFGrid use cases will be announced within 6 months (AYA, some large Communities, and more).
* ThreeFold Cloud will be launched. This might have some very serious impact within 1 year as this leads to commercial offerings.
* Funding for ThreeFold Cloud and TFTech will allow grants to decentralized Development & Promotion Projects (end Q3).
