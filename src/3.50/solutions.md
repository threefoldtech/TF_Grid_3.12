## Introduction

In TFGrid 3.50, we bring more flexibility to solution providers.

In TFGrid 3.50, we remove the existing model and process for the solution providers. Solution providers on their own will be able to add extra fees to deployments or partner with farmers.

In brief, solution providers can buy capacity in bulk and even make deals with selected farmers to get the best price possible. The amount of TFT staked on guardian validators or TF Farms provide additional discounts.

The aim is to make the cost of purchasing capacity as cost effective as possible to allow the solution providers to define their own sales price of their solutions and have healthy margins.

The solution providers who want to co-promote with ThreeFold (be endorsed by ThreeFold) will need to pass an approval process. See the next section for more information on this.

## Solution Providers ThreeFold Endorsement Program

The solution providers who want to be endorsed by ThreeFold (listing on website, co-promotion, etc.) need to make sure that the following requirements are covered:

* They need to have their own Terms and Conditions (T&C).
* Their users need to accept their own Terms and Conditions as well as the Generic TFGrid T&C.
* They need to be very specific about if their technology is open source or not and what the licenses are.
* They need to have a clear description of what their users can expect from a support perspective.
* Their users need to understand that ThreeFold is not responsible for delivering support on the solutions from the solution provider. ThreeFold also cannot take any liability for any malfunctioning.

### What ThreeFold Won't Promote

ThreeFold will not promote solutions which:

* Damage the planet or the people on the planet.
* Are linked to gambling, adult entertainment, hatred, etc. This will need to be further defined.

Note that the Solution Providers ThreeFold Endorsement Program would not lead to more revenues for the approved solution providers. It is an association between ThreeFold and the approved solution providers to provide additional visibility to their solutions and to expand ThreeFoldâ€™s official partnerships.
