## DAO Parameters

The parameters on-chain are all managed by the TFCHAIN DAO:

* Pricing
  * CU/SU basic sales prices are currently 7.20 USD and 3.60 USD per month respectively. ([Source](https://www.manual.grid.tf/cloud/cloudunits_pricing.html))
  * Discount for dedicated nodes. Currently, this discount is 50%.
  * Discount in line with ownership of TFT as staked on validators of guardians. The discount is thus no longer linked to the TFTs contained within the user’s wallet. This allows for more security too, since people need to stake if they want discounts. To be clear, this form of discount replaces the current model with discounts based on the TFT within one’s wallet.
  * The DAO would decide on default prices for CU/SU/NU, as well as IP addresses and dedicated nodes, in order to allow a plug-n-play experience for farmers.
* Validator Benefits
  * Percentage of revenues with 10% for the stakers
* Farming Reward Parameters
  * TFT reward per CU/SU for farmers
  * The parameters for tokenomics as specified above
* Farming Lockup Parameters:
  * There is either a minimum utilization threshold in percentage or a minimum number of months before minting gets released:
    * Both are currently set to 0 for the fixed reward farmers.
    * The parameters will be of one year or a minimum of 30% utilization for the new 3Nodes starting with version 3.50. This means that the tokens which are farmed are locked for one year unless they get a utilization threshold of 30% or more.
    * The tokens that are farmed but not released count as being staked on the farm.
  * The cutoff date for fixed farming reward, for now, is on Dec 30, 2024.
    * Existing farmers will have the choice to opt in or not into the new variable rewards scheme. This means that no new nodes would be eligible for fixed rewards after this date.
* Voting Parameters:
  * Percentage of votes needed
  * Minimum voting period
  * Maximum voting period
* Certified 3Nodes Vendors
* Staking rewards and parameters
* Referral program parameters and requirements
* Decentralized Promotion and Development
  * Percentage of revenue going to TF Treasury, which is at 10% initially.
* Software versions on TFGrid and TFChain
  * Will support rolling upgrade, means first upgrade some farms if good more (Q1 2024)
* TFT generation protection
  * Define TFT vs Milligram of Gold Price
  * Maximum minting of TFT per CU/SU per day is defined in relation to the milligram of gold price, initially this will be 0.0689 USD per milligram (As of the date: 02/08/23, 13:20:01 BST, [Source](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-prices)) .This is a special parameter and it can only be changed with +90% voted, and the vote will need a one month voting period minimum. This ensures that the quantity of TFT produced is healthy for the tokenomics.
