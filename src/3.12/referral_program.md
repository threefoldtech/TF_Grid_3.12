## Referral Program Community Discussion

The idea of a referral program has been widely discussed in this ThreeFold [forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-referral-program/3809).

While there is a consensus from the community on having a referral program, the questions remaining are mostly on how to implement it efficiently.

This document will evolve as we gather input from the community and find the best way to go forward.

## Program Implementation

### Referral Rewards

It should be discussed what will the rewards be. For example, they could be discounts to deploy on the grid, much like the actual workload discounts for wallets with great amount of TFT, or the rewards could also be in the form of TFTs.

### Implementing on Chain

The referral program could be implemented directly in TFChain. 

***

## Program Parameters

We present different parameters that could be integrated into the ThreeFold referral program.

### Educational Content

Equip referrers with educational content about the project so they can effectively communicate its value to potential new members.

This content would be available on the TF Manual for a start. Videos could be done and shared on Youtube and other platforms.

### Tiered Rewards System

Offer increasing rewards for referring multiple people. For instance, for the first 5 referrals, give x reward; for the next 10, give Z reward, and so on.

If the rewards are in discount workloads, it could be as:

* First 5 referrals
  * 15% off workload discount
* Next 10 referrals
  * 25% off workload discounts
* And so on

### Both Sides Benefit

Ensure that both the referrer and the referred get a benefit. This could be in the form of tokens, discounts on services, or early access to new features.

### Milestone Bonuses

Offer extra rewards when referrers hit certain milestones, like 10, 50, or 100 successful referrals.

### Leaderboard and Competitions

Create a monthly or quarterly leaderboard showcasing top referrers. Offer significant rewards for top performers to foster a competitive spiritâ€¦

### Customized Referral Links

Provide users with unique, customizable referral links so they can track their referrals and conversions.

### Engage with Micro Influencers

Encourage micro influencers in the crypto and tech space to join the referral program. Their reach could be beneficial in bringing in a knowledgeable audience.

### Referral Analytics

Allow users to track the status of their referrals, see who signed up, and check their reward status.

### Clear Terms and Conditions

Ensure the rules are transparent, regarding how and when rewards are distributed. this helps build trust in the program.

### Integration with Social Media

Allow easy sharing of referral links on social media platforms with pre made templates or messages highlighting the benefits of joining.

### Special Badges or Recognition

Offer digital badges or some form of recognition that users can display on their profiles, showcasing their contribution to community growth.

### Feedback Loop

Encourage participants to provide feedback on the referral program, allowing for continuous improvement.

### Leverage Existing Community

Engage with our current community members and ask them to bring in people they believe would benefit from the project. 

### Affiliate Partnerships

Consider partnering with relevant platforms or services for an affiliate program, where these partners can earn a commission or benefit for every user they bring in.

### Promotion and Launch

Consider having a launch event or promotional period for the referral program, offering extra benefits or bonuses for a limited time to kickstart participation.
