## Introduction

We want to roll out and improve our validator and staking strategy.
***
## Basics of Staking

Staking can happen on

* ThreeFold Guardian Validators
* ThreeFold Farms

Staking is important for the following reasons:

* You show your support for a farmer or a guardian, because you give them your vote of confidence.
* You show your support for the TFGrid by locking in value and receiving rewards for doing so.
***
## Staking Principles

* 9 to 33 validators are operated by ThreeFold Guardians. We call them Guardian Validators.
  * As block creators are elected based on staking, it is not possible to enforce a lower bound. These numbers (9 to 33) would need to be discussed and approved.
* Every TFT token holder can stake their tokens on Guardian Validator(s) or on the Farm(s) of their choice.
* The minimum number of TFT per validator is 2,000,000 TFT.
* The Guardians and Farmers get votes on the TFChain DAO in relation to the weight of the amount of staked tokens on their Validator or Farm.
* A form of punishment (e.g. slashing) should be implemented in the cases where the authority misbehaves. The incites validators to be constantly effective and will allow stakers to support trusted parties (e.g. validators with few or no failures)
  * Potential slashing events:
    * Failure to participate promptly in minting.
    * Normal PoS slashing events.

## Staking Rewards

The initial rewards for the staking tokens on a Guardian Validator are

* 10% of TFT that is used for utilization of the grid.
* A commission of 20% on above 10% goes to the Validator Operator = The Guardian.

The initial rewards for the staking tokens on a ThreeFold Farm are the following:

* 10% of TFT is used for utilization of the grid.
* A commission of 20% of the 10% (i.e. 2%) goes to the 3Nodes Operator, i.e. the Farmer.
This is only for the tokens that are staked, the farmer gets other rewards in relation to utilization.
