## Introduction

The TFGrid requires a minimum and a maximum of 9 and 33 guardians respectively. There will be a public election process on the TF Forum where all candidate guardians can put forward their candidacy. Guardians can be a group of people and this is highly recommended as it makes it easier for them to execute their duties. This means that the guardian concept should allow a guardian to be owned by more than one person. This would be coupled with a consensus concept and would be used (e.g.) for token retrieval and more.

These guardians will run a blockchain node and execute specific functions for the TFGrid. This means that block creators are selected by code, and not by humans. Authorities will thus be selected solely on the total stake they have on the blockchain.
