## Conclusion

### SIMPLIFY THE GRID

The current format of the TF DAO doesnâ€™t seem to work, nor does the solution provider feature. We have been losing a lot of cycles around this and it created a lot of unhappiness in the community.

We want to remove the Solution Provider feature and replace it with more simple measurements who will also achieve what we wanted to do, as discussed in the present document. As discussed, the DAO also gets simplified and becomes much more specific.

### Requirements and Next Steps

* We need to find 9 Guardians. We will use the TF Forum for this.
* We need approval on this plan on the TF Forum in less than one week.
* We will do one generic DAO vote concerning the current plan on the current chain.
* This needs to happen in less than 2 weeks.
* We need to have confirmation on the required budget from TFCloud and/or TFChain or other parties to make TFGrid 3.12 happen.
* We need to finish the development during the summer.
