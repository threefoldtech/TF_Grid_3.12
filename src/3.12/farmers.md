## Customing Pricing

The idea is to allow a farmer to receive additional rewards for CU/SU. The rewards would be distributed as follows:

1. 70% goes directly to the farmer.
2. 20% goes to the staking reward on validators and farms.
3. 10% goes to the TF Treasury.

## More Income

Farmers get more income (NEW FEATURE)

* Farmers receive 20% on tokens utilization of their node for CU/SU (TFT spent)
* Farmers receive another 10% on tokens utilization for tokens as staked on their own farm.
* Farmers can define additional reward for CU/SU (done per farm)
* Farmers can define price for their GPU or other special requirement (done per 3Node)
* Farmers can define price for NU and IP Addresses (done per farm)
* All extra income for farmers is not linked to burning.

## Help Solution Providers

Ability to help solution providers:
  
* Farmers can give discounts on their additional rewards as specified in this section to selected accounts (e.g. solution providers). Note that this does not allow a farmer to lock down their farm to users. It’s only a discount on the farmer’s additional rewards.
***
## Farmers' Own Nodes Utilization

Simpler for farmers to utilize their own nodes

* Farmers who reserve their own capacity won't pay more TFT than they farm with the same capacity.
***
## Farmers Information

* Farmers can put a link to describe their farm (i.e. a link to their website page or the like).
* Farmers can specify information such as bandwidth, uptime, quality
