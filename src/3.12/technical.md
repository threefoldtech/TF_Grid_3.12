## Technical Details

### Zero-OS 4.0

Zero-OS is our new version of Zero-OS for TFGrid 4.0 and TFGrid 3.12:

* Will be compatible with TFChain 3.x as well as TFChain 4.0 and 3Bot peer-to-peer mode, as we prepare Zero-OS 4.0 for TFGrid 4.0
* Latest Jan 2024, but probably earlier, Zero-OS 4.0 will be upgraded on all Nodes.
* Once Zero-OS 4.0 is active, all new Farms will be part of a Regional Internet using CHI as a local currency, which is backed by TFT which in turn will be our reserve currency.
* Farmers on TFGrid 3.x will have the choice to stay on TFChain 3.x or move to a regional internet with TFChain 4.x.

### Multi User Owned Validators

I think it's good to have a concept where many people together can own a validator and where rules can be set on how tokens can be taken out of the rewards. We would rather have less validators that are properly managed than many validators poorly managed.

### Minting Process

The minting process would include a minting script tool which would run on the guardian nodes where consensus is achieved. This script would log the minting on the TFChain. If the minting is correct, then multisignature accounts from the nine guardians create the money. We also need to make sure that double-spending is never possible.
